I am an MA student in Visual and Media Anthropology at the Freie Universitaet Berlin. I was born in Germany, raised in Kentucky, and spent several years living in Turkey (Istanbul, Kayseri, and Ankara). My current research is focused on the way that noncitizen youth use media for political participation.

Outside of academics, I am a lover of libraries and oil painting. 

This site is a place for thoughts, ideas, projects, readings, and collaborations. Please get in touch if you would like to work together.
